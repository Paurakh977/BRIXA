## 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT

### 2.1 Current Challenges in Construction Sector

#### A. Transparency & Accountability Issues
- **Project Delays**: Contractors consistently fail to complete projects within stipulated timelines
- **Cost Overruns**: Projects frequently exceed budgets due to poor planning and resource management
- **Quality Compromise**: Low-quality materials are substituted to maximize profits
- **Limited Oversight**: Government authorities lack real-time visibility into project progress
- **Corruption & Fraud**: Inflated invoices, ghost workers, and material theft are common

#### B. Professional Credibility Gap
- **No Verified Track Record**: Engineers and contractors lack standardized profiles showcasing past performance
- **Unfair Tender Allocation**: Tender decisions are often not based on merit or past performance
- **Information Asymmetry**: Tender authorities cannot easily verify contractor credentials and work quality

#### C. Operational Inefficiencies
- **Fragmented Communication**: Engineers must coordinate with multiple entities (architects, auditors, suppliers, laborers) through disparate channels
- **Poor Resource Planning**: Difficulty in sourcing quality materials at competitive prices locally
- **Manual Documentation**: Paper-based records are easily manipulated or lost
- **No Progress Analytics**: Lack of data-driven insights for comparing planned vs. actual progress

#### D. Market Disconnection
